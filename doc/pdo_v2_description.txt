"PDO v2" format description
===========================

This is an unofficial description of the file format used by Pepakura Designer
1.x. It can be identified by string '# Pepakura Designer Work Info ver 2' at
the beginning of the file. It's (mostly) text-based, unlike the format used by
newer Pepakura Designer 2.x and 3.x series.
