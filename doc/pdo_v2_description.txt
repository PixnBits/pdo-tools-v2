"PDO v2" format description
===========================

This is an unofficial description of the file format used by Pepakura Designer
1.x. It can be identified by string '# Pepakura Designer Work Info ver 2' at
the beginning of the file. It's (mostly) text-based, unlike the format used by
newer Pepakura Designer 2.x and 3.x series.

Textures
-uncompressed RGB (BGR?) 24bit triplets

Vertices 
X/Y/Z floats

Faces 
4 or 5 lines of data:
1st line: at the end, there's the number of vertices of which it's composed of
2..4/5th line:
  -vertex index
  -2D coordinates: X/Y floats
  -texture coordinates: U/V floats
More than 4 vertices per face are possible in newer format, however it doesn't
seem like they are supported here as well.
